<p>
Sergio Granada-Moreno is a music producer and sound artist from Bogota, Colombia, 
operating at the nexus between production, composition and music technology. 
Presently he is dedicated to the development of digital audio interface design for 
assorted artistic projects, involving hip hop music production, sound design and 
multimedia performance. He recently joined the <a href="http://www.uniandes.edu.co/" target='blank'>Music Department of the University 
of Los Andes (Colombia)</a>, where he teaches music harmony and leads a workshop in 
music technology.</p>

<p>His early influences in music include grunge and punk bands from the early 
1990s as well as electronic dance music related to the teknival movement, 
including acid techno, D&B, frenchcore and technoid. Coming from such a 
background he became fascinated by acousmatic and soundscape composition and since 
2008 he has been an active composer of tape music, live electronics and multimedia 
performance. Developing his own sound sources and processes using custom recording 
and interface design are an essential part of his artistic direction.</p>

<p>Granada-Moreno holds an MA in Advanced Music Technology from the <a href="http://www.uwl.ac.uk/academic-schools/music" target='blank'>London 
College of Music (University of West London)</a>, as well as a BA General Musicianship 
degree, concentrating in Electroacoustic Composition and Music Production 
(<a href="http://www.uniandes.edu.co/" target='blank'>University of Los Andes, Colombia</a>). During his studies he collaborated in 
variegated projects including design and production of interactive installations 
(2015), development of interactive technology applied to multimedia performance 
(2011-2012), composition of pieces for jazz piano quartet (2008-2011), and sound 
design for music books published by <a href="http://www.cdsystems.com.co/" target='blank'>CD Systems Colombia S.A.</a> (2010). He had also 
performed as recordist of contemporary and classical music, as in the absolute 
premiere and first recording of ‘y el movimiento se detiene en el aire’ by 
Jacqueline Nova, as well as in the recording of other pieces written by composers 
as Luciano Berio, John Cage, M. Schafer and Michael Pisaro.</p>

<p>In between 2010-2013 he worked at the <a href="http://www.cartagenamusicfestival.com/" target='blank'>Salvi Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.canalrcn.com/" target='blank'>television 
network RCN T.V.</a>, leading first-class events regarding classical and popular 
music in Colombia. While working in different cities he performed either as 
stage manager, production assistant and production coordinator, moving in between 
Bogota, Cartagena, Cali and Medellin. Performances organised by the Salvi 
Foundation included music as Golijov’s La Pasión según San Marcos, Pergolesi’s 
Stabat Mater, Villalobos’ Bachianas Brasileras, Vivaldi’s La Notte, and presented 
artists such as the London Symphony Orchestra, Rinaldo Alessandrini´s Concerto 
Italiano, Mario Brunello´s Baroque Experience and Salvatore Accardo String Quartet. 
Granada-Moreno produced also promotional CDs and DVDs related to the forenamed 
performances and in between 2012-2013 he worked in Italy with the record label 
Egea and recording and mixing engineer Angelo Cioffi.</p>

<p>Granada-Moreno has been awarded by the colombian Ministry of Culture 
(Artistic & Cultural Education Abroad Scholarship, 2015), the University of 
West London (Ambassador Scholarship, 2014) and the University of Los Andes 
(academic excellence, 2010). His musical compositions Landscape Mixtures (2010) 
and Digital Rainbow (2009) had been performed in several venues in Colombia as 
well as at the FILE Hypersonica in Sao Paulo, Brazil (2011). His most recent 
productions in popular music involve Cloud rap and ambient music, producing 
instrumental tracks independently in a project blending interface design and 
record production, influenced by the work of producers such as J Dilla, Clams 
Casino, Benny Blanco, Brandun DeShay and Beautiful Lou; he is currently working 
in this direction on his latest release in the form of a bundle, including a 
five-track EP and a couple of Max For Live devices due for release in 2017.
